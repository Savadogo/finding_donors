    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "The three models I will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Logistic Regression (1)\n",
    "> **- Real world application:** Logistic regression can be used in the real world for classification purpose. For instance in the banking sector this model is used for credit scoring, which consist in classifying client between potential insolvent or solvent borrower. The model is used to evaluate if a new client applying for a loan will be able to pay back the money. In practice, the model use features related to the client (age, monthly income....) to predict if a client will be insolvent or not (e.g. 1 for insolvent and 0 otherwise). A binomial logistic regression is well suited to respond to that type of problematic. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**- The strengths of the model:**  The principal strength of the logistic regression lies in the fact that on contrary to other machine learning models, its coefficients can be easily interpreted. The model allow the users to evaluate accuratly the impact of each features on the label. Logistic regression is a low variance predictive model. It is also less demanding in term of implementation and computational resources compared to other machine learning models.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**- The weakness of the model:** the logistic regression assume independence between the different variables and does not take the interraction between the variable into account. This model also suppose a linear relation between the probability odds and the features. These simplifications could lead to less accurate results compared to more complexe models. Logistic Regression is also a high biasis predictive model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**- Reason to choose this model for this data:**  Giving the binomial nature of the outcome variable to predict the logistic regression seems adapted to respond to our goal. With the size of our trainning set (36177), we can expect our logistic regression algorithm to converge to a stable result. The model is also simple to implement and can also be used as a base of comparaison with the other two models.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " ### K-Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "> **-Real world application:** K-NN models can be used for classificaion or regression purposes. This model could be use in real world to build recommendation systems (movies, books) or recongnize handwritten digits.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-The strengths of the model(6)(7):** The K-NN algorithm is very simple to implement and update, as it doesnt build any predictif model. K-NN does not take an training time and its results are also easy to interpret. The K-NN is a non-parametric method and does not make any assumptions on the distribution of the data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-The weakness of the model(6)(7):** K-NN is very sensitive to outliers and does not deal very well with missing values (due to the fact that prediction are made by calculating th closest neighbors). KNN is also a very slow algorithm for large datasets, as for each prediction the model need to calculate the distance for each point of the dataset. The model can also be demanding in term of resources, as all the training data need to be stored.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-Reason to choose this model for this data(5):** The K-NN model is suitable to predict binomial categories, and that is our purpose. With the size of our training data (<100K), we can expect our algorithm to run within an acceptable time. We also dont have any missing values in our dataset, and the data has been scaled to reduce the effect of outliners. K-NN is a good candidate to build a predictive model for the donors.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Gradient Boosting \n",
    "> **-Real world application:** This model can also be used in real world for regression, ranking or classification purpose. Gradient Boosting can be used for instance to build learning ranking functions for web search. According to Wikipedia, Yahoo and Yandex use a variant of this model as a learning to rank engines.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-The strengths of the model(2)(3)(4):**  The Gradient Boosting model is very flexible, as it provides several hyperparameters for tuning option. It also provide different loss functions, allowing more flexibility to the fitting process. This model also works with categorical and numerical values and often outperforms the other supervised models, since the model can be tuned to reduce considerably the biasis. The Gradient Boosting model is capable of dealing very well with missing value problem.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-The weakness of the model(2)(3)(4):**  The strength of the Gradient Boosting could also constitute one of its weakness. The model tend to reduce considerably the bias, and this could lead to more variance (overfitting). The model could also be demanding in computing resources (time and memory), as it often requires generation of many weak learners. The tuning of the severable hyperparameters could also require more time and resources to achieve convergence. The gradient boosting also suffers from one of the biggest weakness of machine learning models, which is the difficulty to evaluate precisely the impact of the features.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**-Reason to choose this model for this data(5):**  Our purpose is to build a model which predict a category, giving a set of categorical and numerical features. Our test set is also large enough with labeled data. We also notice that the category to predict are not balanced (only 25% of the individuals earn more than 50 K). Giving all this reasons, using the Gradient Boosting model as a supervised mqchine learning model with no assumptions on the data is a good option to build an accurate predicting model.<br>\n",

    "When 100% of the data is used, the KNeighbors Classifier has the highest Accuracy and Fscore on the train data (84% and 78%).Netherveless, we note that this model does not perform that well when 100% of the test data is used : Its F-score is 63% and it take more than 40 second to compute the predictions. The two other model perform better than the KNeighbors Classifier on the test data, so we will choose one of those two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GradientBoosting Classifier(GBC) has a better Accuracy score and F-score than the Logistic Regression on both the train and test sets when 100% of the sets are used : Its F-score on the 100% test data was 74% and its Accuracy score 86%. The GBC also produce its predictions in less than one second, and train with the data in 8s. I consider this time of training acceptable for the level of F-score and Accuracy score. It is true that this model seems to overfit for the 1% samples, but the model is stable for the 10% and 100% samples. Since we have enough data to ensure the sustainability of the model, I will choose the GradientBoosting Classifier as my final model.\n"

    "Gradient Boosting can be seen as a group of students in a classroom learning together to have a better understanding on a subject. The elements of the subject are the output data to predict, and for each value of the output data there is a set of information the teacher provide to the students in order to help them find the right answer. This set of information are the features, and each student has to define a response rules based on the information provided by their teacher. The professor interrogate his students one after another, and each student has access to all the information provided by the teacher and the answers of those who have already been interrogated before him. Before setting his rule each student analyse the mistakes made by his predecesor by comparing the previous responses with the real output data. After analysing the mistakes made by its predecesor, the student define his responses rule by trying to not make the same mistakes made by his predecessor (reduce the number of mistakes). This interrogation session where the students define their responses rules can be seen as the training step of the Gradient Boosting. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this training session, the Teacher provide to the classroom information on a new element of the subject and ask his classroom to guess the output. To predict the output, each student provide an answer (based on his reponses rule he defined in the training step) and all the answer are combined to provide an unique answer for the classroom: this answer is the prediction. The answer combination rule also has to be define : it can be for instance by voting. <br>\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
